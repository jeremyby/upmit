    %h4 How to create a goal?
    %p
      Breaking down a goal into smaller, more concrete sub-goals is the more efficient way to achieve the goal.
      A goal on Upmit.com is made of 
      %strong actionable commitments
      that will last for 
      %strong a certain period
      and occur with
      %strong certain frequency,
      say, daily or weekly.
      
    %p
      Let's say someone has a goal: I want to start jogging regularly. A good goal on Upmit could be:
      I will jog for 30 minutes (commitment), every 2 days (frequency), for 2 months (duration).
      
    %p There are two more options for new goals. The goal defaults to start the next day or the next week, but you can change it to today or this week. Privacy determines who can see the details of your goals.

      You can create your goal at:

    %h4 Why I am asked to pay deposit?
    %p Because the fear of losing one's own money is a great motivation. For every day scheduled for your commitment, we ask you to deposit $1. For every day you scheduled to action, you have to check in with us that you have achieved the commitment on that day, to earn $1 back.
    
    %h4 Is my deposit safe?
    %p
      %strong Yes, absolutely.
      Your deposit is guaranteed 100%.
